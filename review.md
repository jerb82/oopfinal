## Lambda Functions

### Be able to write with capture and parameters

| Lambda         | Description                | Parameter      |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| [](char c) {   | Output character           | IN             |
|    std::cout << c; |                          |                |
| }              |                            |                |
| [](char& c) {  | Convert to uppercase       | IN/OUT         |
|    c = std::toupper(c); |                    |                |
| }             |                            |                |

The captures of a lambda are whatever is within the [], there can be empty captures, or you have have it be when you want to pass in everything, or we can name everything that we pass in, one by one,


## RAII
### Resource Acquisition Is Initialization
Constructor: Allocate resource
Destructor: Deallocate resource

Prevents resource leaks, double-free, use when invalid

How to implement?


## SOLID

Know the list of principles, both abbreviations and full names

### Principles 
* **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* **O**pen/closed Principle (OCP)
* **L**iskov Substitution Principal (LSP)
* **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


## Coupling
Definition, list of types of coupling, why decoupling is important

Degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are; the strength of the relationships between modules

Types of Coupling
-  Message Coupling *(very best)*
- Data Coupling *(best)* 
- Stamp Coupling  
- Control Coupling  
- Common Coupling
- Content Coupling *(worst)*

Why is it important?
- Perhaps the most important characteristics of a system
- Affects development path
- Affects how we partition the system for testing
- Affects how much reuse is possible
- Significant effect on the complexity of a system

## API 

### Application Programming Interface

- Large-scale mechanism for *separation of concerns*
(need to add more, there wasn't much in the slides)
